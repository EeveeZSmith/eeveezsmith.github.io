<h1>Absolute Length Units</h1>
	<p>Absolute length units are those that exist as a definite, independent unit of measurement. Regardless of how or where they are used, they appear as a standard, constant size.</p>
	<p>Example: 1 pixel (px) is always 1/96th of 1 inch.</p>
	<h1>Relative Length Units</h1>
	<p>Relative length units are those whose measurement is determined in relation to something else, such as another object on the page or a percentrage of the screen on which the page is viewed.</p>
	<p>Example: Viewport width (vw) tells an object to take up a percentage of the device's screen.</p>
